- convert to poco
- add socket.io

STATUS:
- basic classes for communication, missing socket.io, need to decide on lib
- hacked together csv code for bitcoincharts.com

NEED:
- to read and store ordertable history
- to simulate a trend line calculation going over past history to see how well it predicts future

IDEAS:
- could compose code with target timescale i.e. say I want to engage things X frequently
(daily, hourly, monthly)
  : need to find trend such that value crosses over trend that often, needs to be so far apart

CONCEPTS:
- generic view of trade data
  . start time, end time, size of average window
- trading strategy
  . for example:
    . compose a line with std deviation, buy when > stddev, sell when < stddev
    . abandon strategy if > 1.5 * stddev away
  . if we can compartmentalize this into a class we can throw it at the history and decide how
    it performs in various ways
- "wallet"
  . currencies, for each:
    . total amount
    . set of currencies represented, value in those currencies
  . trading fee?
